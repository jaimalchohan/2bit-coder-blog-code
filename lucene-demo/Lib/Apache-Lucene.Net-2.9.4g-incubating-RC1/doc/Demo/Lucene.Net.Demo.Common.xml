            "expectedTokenSequences", and "tokenImage" do not contain
            relevant information.  The JavaCC generated code does not use

            error message and returns it.  If this object has been created
            due to a parse error, and you do not catch it (it gets thrown
            from the parser), then this method is called during the printing
